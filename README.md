I had a Friday night alone at home, so here are some more advanced and flexible answers to some of the 99 Prolog Problems and Project Euler challenges.

Main differences with other answers that I've seen (aside from the fact that this is Erlang) are:
- Flatten list (#7 of 99 Prolog Problems) purely recursion based.
- Packing of consecutive numbers (#9 of 99 Prolog Problems) purely function/recursion based.
- All Project Euler answers have flexible inputs instead of hardcoded numbers.
- Finding largest divisible prime number (#3 of Project Euler) is math based and not brute forced.
